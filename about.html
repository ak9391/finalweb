	For this project, I wanted to shed light on access to the Internet for young children. I was first given access to the Internet when I was 6 years old. At first, I downloaded games and apps. One app Youtube was what changed everything. From watching Barbie, and miniature cooking videos to something a 6-year-old should not be watching. I feel a part of myself has been taken away since then and I wish wasn't exposed to the stuff on the internet. It could have gone so wrong but thankfully I didn't go off into the wrong side. But the Internet also taught me things and there is so much more to learn. <br>You have access to everything but there needs to be a line drawn in terms of the content being visible to children.|
